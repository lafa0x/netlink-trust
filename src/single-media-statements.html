                            1 September 2020 – NetLink Trust (“NetLink”) is offering promotional pricing for its Non-Residential Connection Service (“Non-Residential Service”) to Service Providers targeted at reducing fibre broadband cost for small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”).
                            <br><br>
                            NetLink’s offer is aimed at helping Singapore SMEs accelerate their adoption of digital technologies during this challenging COVID-19 period. Participating Service Providers will receive rebates for each new Non-Residential Service connection that they applied for their SME customer. The rebates will be in the form of a waiver of the Monthly Recurring Charge (“MRC”) for the Non-Residential Service for a period of 12 months. NetLink hopes that its offer will help Service Providers create more competitive fixed broadband offers to SMEs, at a time when many businesses are badly affected by COVID-19. 
                            <br><br>
                            Interested SMEs may approach their Service Providers and enquire about NetLink’s offer. This promotion is valid for new orders from 1 September 2020 till 28 February 2021.
                            <br><br>
                            Mr Tong Yew Heng (唐耀兴), Chief Executive Officer of NetLink, said, “As a Singapore entity, it’s important for us to do our part to help local businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many SMEs are affected by the economic downturn brought on by the pandemic. We hope that SMEs will take advantage of this promotion and leverage on the high-speed internet access offered by NetLink’s network to conduct their businesses online and accelerate the digitalisation of their businesses.”
